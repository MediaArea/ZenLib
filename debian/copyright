 By submission of a Contribution, each person actually submitting the
 Contribution, and each named co-Contributor, is deemed to agree to
 the following terms and conditions, and to grant the following
 rights, on his or her own behalf and on behalf of the organization
 the Contributor represents or is sponsored by (if any) when
 submitting the Contribution.
 .
 a. To the extent that a Contribution or any portion thereof is
    protected by copyright and other rights of authorship, the
    Contributor, and each named co-Contributor, and the organization
    he or she represents or is sponsored by (if any) grant a
    perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, world-wide
    right and license to the ISOC and the IETF under all intellectual
    property rights in the Contribution:
 .
    (A) to copy, publish, display, and distribute the Contribution as
        part of the IETF Standards Process or in an Internet-Draft,
 .
    (B) to prepare or allow the preparation of translations of the
        Contribution into languages other than English,
 .
    (C) unless explicitly disallowed in the notices contained in a
        Contribution [as per Section 5.2 below], to prepare derivative
        works (other than translations) that are based on or
        incorporate all or part of the Contribution, or comment upon
        it, within the IETF Standards Process.  The license to such
        derivative works not granting the ISOC and the IETF any more
        rights than the license to the original Contribution,
 .
    (D) to reproduce any trademarks, service marks or trade names
        which are included in the Contribution solely in connection
        with the reproduction, distribution or publication of the
        Contribution and derivative works thereof as permitted by this
        paragraph.  When reproducing Contributions, the IETF will
        preserve trademark and service mark identifiers used by the
        Contributor of the Contribution, including (TM) and (R) where
        appropriate, and
 .
    (E) to extract, copy, publish, display, distribute, modify and
        incorporate into other works, for any purpose (and not limited
        to use within the IETF Standards Process) any executable code
        or code fragments that are included in any IETF Document (such
        as MIB and PIB modules), subject to the requirements of
        Section 5 (it also being understood that the licenses granted
        under this paragraph (E) shall not be deemed to grant any
        right under any patent, patent application or other similar
        intellectual property right disclosed by the Contributor under
        [RFC3979]).
